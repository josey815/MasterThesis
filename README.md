Topic : Demand parameters estimation and dynamic pricing considering reference prices

Main contribution :
1. Incorporate reference prices into the field of dynamic pricing, make the market environment much more realistic.
2. Apply Multinomial logit model (MNL) to simulate customers' purchase behavior between multiple alternatives.
3. Adopt LSTM neural network to estimate the unknown demand parameters in MNL model.
4. Take estimated demand parameters with other state parameters as input of dynamic pricing model, let it generate the optimal pricing strategy at each period in the selling horizon.
5. Apply adaptive training to overcome the mismatch between initial perception and realistic situation in the market environment, let model be self-adaptive to current market environment through the upgrade process of knowledge level.
